# FigmaChallange
In this design I use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
I use CDN links for bootstrap4. 
I use different classes of bootstrap in this page and different media queries to make the design responsive.  
I also use font Awesome to add menu button to show the menu bar on the mobile devices.


Thanks.
